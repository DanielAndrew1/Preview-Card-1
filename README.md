## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned that I can just change the value of flex wrap in media queries to solve the main problem of mobile response.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue learning Bootstrap so that I can implement it in projects like this next time.
